Rationale
=========
There are many projects out there that both in github and online that offer dns manage and dumping of dns data. But we at `https://www.nmmapper.com <https://www.nmmapper.com>`_ wanted to unify lot of python tools out there that perform dns recon so that we can host it online. Like we did unify and host `8 subdomain finder tools <https://www.nmmapper.com/sys/tools/subdomainfinder/>`_.

Our approach to this tool is to dump as match information about a given host as possible. The tool is still in development and we continue to add more features on it.
